## project introduction
### background of the whole world
Based on concepts such as the Internet of Things, China defines Industry 4.0 in the primary sector as Agriculture 4.0 (or Farming 4.0), and its methodology has been studied in some rural areas.Correspondingly, the agricultural revolution can also be hypothesized, which is closely related to recent innovations in the industrial sector.The revolution in agricultural technology began with the "Animal Power" of "Agriculture 1.0".The internal combustion engine then defined "agriculture 2.0";A few years ago, with the introduction of military GPS signals to the public, and the advent of navigation systems and precision agriculture, "Agriculture 3.0" took shape.Today, it is the "Agriculture 4.0" era of farm activities and cloud connections.However, following European agricultural machinery in 2017, the next step in "Agriculture 5.0" will include digitally integrated enterprises, which rely on production processes using robots and some forms of artificial intelligence.
### development of agriculture in CHINA
China's crop and fruit tree planting area of the scale of gradual growth, crop diversity and the use of fruit trees is dwarfed dense planting pattern, coupled with the declining supply of agricultural labor force, and modern agriculture relies heavily on herbicide weeding, causing harm to our health and soil consolidation.At present, the market demand for agricultural machinery through the sex, applicability, matching models are less, and the technical content is low.The development of high-end agricultural machinery is still in its initial stage and cannot meet the market demand. Therefore, it is necessary to design and develop a modern agricultural machinery suitable for automatic control, so as to adapt to large-scale orchard planting and management, improve soil organic matter and eliminate the use of herbicides.
Relatively speaking, there is an obvious gap between China and developed countries, such as the combination of agricultural and animal husbandry technology and mechanical equipment is not close enough, domestic stability, failure rate, ease of use and other indicators are not ideal, high production cost, low production efficiency, low degree of intelligence, and significant gap between core algorithms.
But farm in the future will be no one farm, will need a lot of agricultural robots, many domestic research institutions and companies are also discussed no farm, and construction of the unmanned demonstration farm, although the study of robot in China started relatively late, but the industry is developing rapidly, at the same time, policy support, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and National Development and Reform Commission, Ministry of Finance has jointly issued earlier in the robot industry development planning (2016-2020) ", it provides new opportunities for the further development of agricultural robot.[3]
### market expectation
At present, agricultural robots have become a hot spot in the world, and the CAGR of AI application in agriculture is 22.68 percent from 2017 to 2021, according to the analysis.It is estimated to be $11.1 billion in 2020 and $30.8 billion in 2025, mainly including agricultural drones, unmanned tractors, intelligent harvesters, intelligent weeding machines, milking robots, agricultural automation and control systems, etc.The wide application of agricultural robots is an important factor for the rapid development of artificial intelligence agricultural market.At present, China's agricultural robot research output has surpassed that of the United States, with a focus on harvesting and picking robots.
