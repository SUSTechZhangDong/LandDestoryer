## project introduction
### background of the whole world
Based on concepts such as the Internet of Things, China defines Industry 4.0 in the primary sector as Agriculture 4.0 (or Farming 4.0), and its methodology has been studied in some rural areas.Correspondingly, the agricultural revolution can also be hypothesized, which is closely related to recent innovations in the industrial sector.The revolution in agricultural technology began with the "Animal Power" of "Agriculture 1.0".The internal combustion engine then defined "agriculture 2.0";A few years ago, with the introduction of military GPS signals to the public, and the advent of navigation systems and precision agriculture, "Agriculture 3.0" took shape.Today, it is the "Agriculture 4.0" era of farm activities and cloud connections.However, following European agricultural machinery in 2017, the next step in "Agriculture 5.0" will include digitally integrated enterprises, which rely on production processes using robots and some forms of artificial intelligence.
At the same time, based on the concept of future manufacturing, the development of Agriculture 4.0 is parallel to that of Industry 4.0.Like Industry 4.0, Agriculture 4.0 represents a combination of internal and external interactions of agricultural operations, providing digital information on all agricultural sectors and processes.Even in agriculture, as in the industrial sector, the 4.0 Revolution represents a great opportunity to consider changes and uncertainties in the agri-food production chain.As a result of the integration and integration of production technology and equipment, information and communication systems, data and services in the network infrastructure, factories become smarter, more efficient, safer and more environmentally sustainable.To remain competitive in the marketplace, smart farms must be able to adapt to these changes automatically and in real time.One of the main requirements that needs to be met is continuous communication between the market and production and within the business itself.Virtualization is the way to effectively connect all participants in this continuous, data-rich communication.[1]
Intelligent agricultural robot is a typical development direction in the era of Agriculture 4.0.Agricultural robot refers to a kind of agricultural products as the operating object, and has some human information perception and body movement functions. It is a reproducible and programmable flexible automation or semi-automation equipment that integrates a variety of disciplines.
Agricultural robots can gradually replace human labor and help reduce labor intensity in agricultural production. At the same time, they can also improve labor efficiency and help solve the problem of labor scarcity in many countries.Agricultural machinery has been paid more and more attention by developed countries with less agricultural population and has become one of the focal points of technological competition in the international agricultural equipment industry.
After the appearance of agricultural robots, the development of many countries in the research and development of agricultural robots, there are a variety of types of agricultural robots.Japan is now at the head of the world.After entering the 21st century, new multi-functional agricultural robots are increasingly widely used, and intelligent robots will more and more replace manual agricultural work in the vast fields, and the second agricultural revolution will be further developed.Different from the industrial robot, it is a new multi-functional agricultural machinery.The wide application of agricultural robots has changed the traditional way of agricultural labor, improved the labor force of farmers and promoted the development of modern agriculture.At present, the common agricultural robots on the market mainly include: fertilizing robot, weeding robot, picking robot and sorting robot.
