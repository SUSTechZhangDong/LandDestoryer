## project introduction
### background of the whole world
Based on concepts such as the Internet of Things, China defines Industry 4.0 in the primary sector as Agriculture 4.0 (or Farming 4.0), and its methodology has been studied in some rural areas.Correspondingly, the agricultural revolution can also be hypothesized, which is closely related to recent innovations in the industrial sector.The revolution in agricultural technology began with the "Animal Power" of "Agriculture 1.0".The internal combustion engine then defined "agriculture 2.0";A few years ago, with the introduction of military GPS signals to the public, and the advent of navigation systems and precision agriculture, "Agriculture 3.0" took shape.Today, it is the "Agriculture 4.0" era of farm activities and cloud connections.However, following European agricultural machinery in 2017, the next step in "Agriculture 5.0" will include digitally integrated enterprises, which rely on production processes using robots and some forms of artificial intelligence.
At the same time, based on the concept of future manufacturing, the development of Agriculture 4.0 is parallel to that of Industry 4.0.Like Industry 4.0, Agriculture 4.0 represents a combination of internal and external interactions of agricultural operations, providing digital information on all agricultural sectors and processes.Even in agriculture, as in the industrial sector, the 4.0 Revolution represents a great opportunity to consider changes and uncertainties in the agri-food production chain.As a result of the integration and integration of production technology and equipment, information and communication systems, data and services in the network infrastructure, factories become smarter, more efficient, safer and more environmentally sustainable.To remain competitive in the marketplace, smart farms must be able to adapt to these changes automatically and in real time.One of the main requirements that needs to be met is continuous communication between the market and production and within the business itself.Virtualization is the way to effectively connect all participants in this continuous, data-rich communication.[1]
Intelligent agricultural robot is a typical development direction in the era of Agriculture 4.0.Agricultural robot refers to a kind of agricultural products as the operating object, and has some human information perception and body movement functions. It is a reproducible and programmable flexible automation or semi-automation equipment that integrates a variety of disciplines.
Agricultural robots can gradually replace human labor and help reduce labor intensity in agricultural production. At the same time, they can also improve labor efficiency and help solve the problem of labor scarcity in many countries.Agricultural machinery has been paid more and more attention by developed countries with less agricultural population and has become one of the focal points of technological competition in the international agricultural equipment industry.
After the appearance of agricultural robots, the development of many countries in the research and development of agricultural robots, there are a variety of types of agricultural robots.Japan is now at the head of the world.After entering the 21st century, new multi-functional agricultural robots are increasingly widely used, and intelligent robots will more and more replace manual agricultural work in the vast fields, and the second agricultural revolution will be further developed.Different from the industrial robot, it is a new multi-functional agricultural machinery.The wide application of agricultural robots has changed the traditional way of agricultural labor, improved the labor force of farmers and promoted the development of modern agriculture.At present, the common agricultural robots on the market mainly include: fertilizing robot, weeding robot, picking robot and sorting robot.
### development of agriculture in CHINA
China's crop and fruit tree planting area of the scale of gradual growth, crop diversity and the use of fruit trees is dwarfed dense planting pattern, coupled with the declining supply of agricultural labor force, and modern agriculture relies heavily on herbicide weeding, causing harm to our health and soil consolidation.At present, the market demand for agricultural machinery through the sex, applicability, matching models are less, and the technical content is low.The development of high-end agricultural machinery is still in its initial stage and cannot meet the market demand. Therefore, it is necessary to design and develop a modern agricultural machinery suitable for automatic control, so as to adapt to large-scale orchard planting and management, improve soil organic matter and eliminate the use of herbicides.
Relatively speaking, there is an obvious gap between China and developed countries, such as the combination of agricultural and animal husbandry technology and mechanical equipment is not close enough, domestic stability, failure rate, ease of use and other indicators are not ideal, high production cost, low production efficiency, low degree of intelligence, and significant gap between core algorithms.
But farm in the future will be no one farm, will need a lot of agricultural robots, many domestic research institutions and companies are also discussed no farm, and construction of the unmanned demonstration farm, although the study of robot in China started relatively late, but the industry is developing rapidly, at the same time, policy support, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and National Development and Reform Commission, Ministry of Finance has jointly issued earlier in the robot industry development planning (2016-2020) ", it provides new opportunities for the further development of agricultural robot.[3]
### market expectation
At present, agricultural robots have become a hot spot in the world, and the CAGR of AI application in agriculture is 22.68 percent from 2017 to 2021, according to the analysis.It is estimated to be $11.1 billion in 2020 and $30.8 billion in 2025, mainly including agricultural drones, unmanned tractors, intelligent harvesters, intelligent weeding machines, milking robots, agricultural automation and control systems, etc.The wide application of agricultural robots is an important factor for the rapid development of artificial intelligence agricultural market.At present, China's agricultural robot research output has surpassed that of the United States, with a focus on harvesting and picking robots.
